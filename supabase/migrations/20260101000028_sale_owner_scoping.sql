-- Audit C05: a sale queued offline was credited to whoever was signed in when it
-- synced, not to who rang it up.
--
-- record_sale already credits the CALLER'S session (auth.uid()) and ignores any
-- cashier in the payload, which is right and stays: the server never trusts a
-- client-supplied cashier. The bug was on the device (one global queue, synced
-- by whoever was signed in). The device now scopes its queue per user, and this
-- migration adds two server-side pieces:
--
--   1. record_sale(..., p_expected_cashier): an assertion that REFUSES the sale
--      when the caller is not the expected user. A race that sends A's sale under
--      B's session now fails instead of being recorded under B.
--   2. recover_sale: owner only. For a sale stranded on a device by a user who
--      cannot sign back in (or a legacy sale with no user id). Recorded under the
--      OWNER, flagged recovered_by_owner, and the original cashier (if known) is
--      kept in activity_log. Idempotent by sale id.

alter table public.sales
  add column recovered_by_owner boolean not null default false;

-- A new parameter changes the signature: replace the 6-argument function. Calls
-- that send six named arguments still resolve (the new one defaults to null).
